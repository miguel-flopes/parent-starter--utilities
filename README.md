# parent-starter--utilities
Shared library for utility classes in a micro-system architecture

## how it works
The current version of this library is set in the parent internal dependencies pom.xml. <br>
No dependency versions should be set in this pom.xml file. That responsibility belongs to the parent in the 'dependencyManagement' section.
